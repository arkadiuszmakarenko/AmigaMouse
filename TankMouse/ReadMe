USE

The scroll wheel driver after successful installation in User-startup,
should start automatically and provide translation of signals produced by your mouse RF receiver
attached to the DE9 connector, e.g. through provided adapter.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Operation can be verified through RawKeys (http://aminet.net/package/dev/moni/Rawkeys)
which monitors signals coming from input devices such as keyboards, and mice.
TankMouse produces signals:

- Wheel forward
- Wheel backward

If desired, the direction of wheel mouse can be reversed by the argument option:

* VREV (abrev. V) - up/down
* HREV (abrev. H) - left/right
