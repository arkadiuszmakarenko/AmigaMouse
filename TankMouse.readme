Author:       Szymon Bieganski (SQ7BTI)
Type:         driver/input
Version:      0.3
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 2.0.4
Distribution: Aminet

USE

The scroll wheel driver after successful installation in User-startup, should start automatically and provide translation of signals produced by your mouse attached to the DE9 connector, e.g. through provided adapter.
Provided Installer script adds an entry to User-Startup, so if there was already installed one for Cocolino, please remove it manually.
Optional runtime arguments:
- VREV (S) to reverse vertical axis (UP/DOWN)

FreeWheel (http://aminet.net/package/util/mouse/FreeWheel) could be useful to fine-tune your mouse

TROUBLESHOOTING

Driver can be started from shell. Avoid starting it in parallel with a running instance. Can be stopped by CTR-C and upon exit will produce some statistics.
Operation can be verified through RawKeys (http://aminet.net/package/dev/moni/Rawkeys) which monitors signals coming from input devices such as keyboards, and mice.
TankMouse.driver processes signals other signals produced by connected mice, but TankMouse support scroll forward and backward only.
Please report any incompatibilities of this driver with other adapter supporting (subset of) Cocolino driver and other mice.
