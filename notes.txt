NOTES
=====

The Middle mouse button is emulated, it does not use the real middle mouse button pin.
This is because this pin is used for communication between the Amiga and Arduino for 
scroll wheel etc.

PS2_to_Amiga.ino is based heavily on his PS2_to_Quadrature_Mouse.ino
I used an interrupt driver PS/2 library instead if his.

Designed for a PS/2 keyboard but works perfectly with a mouse.  Interrupt driven.

ERROR CODES
===========
Errors will be shown by flashing the onboard LED:

2 = Error resetting PS/2 mouse
3 = Error changing sample rate (non-intellimouse?)
4 = Error reading ID (non-intellimouse?)
5 = Unable to begin PS2 protocol
6 = Unable to enable Data Reporting



OUTSTANDING ISSUES
==================
Scroll wheel does not work if the left or right mouse button is held down.
This is not a problem for the right mouse but would be nice for the left.
Do other mouse adapters support this?
